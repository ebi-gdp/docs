# About the `GeneticScores.org` calculation service

## What does it do?

This tool:

* Calculates polygenic scores from existing scoring files in the PGS Catalog (i.e. the application of weights specified in an existing polygenic score to the variants present in target genomes that you supply)

It does this by running the [PGS Catalog Calculator pipeline](https://github.com/pgscatalog/pgsc_calc) on your input genomes that you upload.

## What doesnâ€™t it do?

* This tool does not create new polygenic scores (the list of variants and weights, otherwise known as polygenic scoring files).
* This tool does not estimate absolute risk

## Who should use this service?

This service is aimed at AI developers or human health researchers looking to calculate polygenic scores in cohort data.

## What do I put in?

* Target genomes of a group of individuals
* Genome build of your target genomes

## What do I get out?

After the calculation has finished:

* Individual level scores (one number per score per person)

A report describing:

* Pipeline parameters used
* Scoring file information
* How well variants matched target genomes
* Example PGS distributions if enough samples are present

[An explanation of the output report is available here.](explain/report.md) The report is a HTML file that [opens in your web browser.](pathname:///files/test_report.html)


:::note

Although the PGS Catalog Calculator supports genetic ancestry similarity analysis, `GeneticScores.org` does not support this currently.

## What is the process?

See our [getting started guide](gettingstarted.md).

## How long does it take?

Calculation can take several hours to finish depending on the size of your uploaded genomes and how busy the service is.

## Who makes this?

The platform is a product of the INTERVENE consortium, it has been created by the team at EMBL-EBI, in collaboration with the University of Cambridge for `pgsc_calc`. It runs on Google Cloud Platform.

## Can I run this in my own environment?

The calculation pipeline run by the platform, the PGS Catalog Calculator, as well as associated tools and libraries, are available to be run in [offline local environments.](./tools)
