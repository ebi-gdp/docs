# Introduction

The INTERVENE platform aims to makes it easy to calculate polygenic risk scores. 

* Upload genomes securely to our platform
* We process data with the [PGS Catalog Calculator](https://pgsc-calc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Download a score report and we'll delete your data

:::caution

* Please do not upload real genomes to the platform
* We use synthetic genomes like [HAPNEST](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37647640/) for testing
* The platform and documentation is **being actively developed and tested**

If you don't want to upload your genomes and prefer to calculate scores on your own computer, try downloading the [PGS Catalog Calculator](https://pgsc-calc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
