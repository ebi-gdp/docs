# Upload genomes with your web browser

Upload genomes with your web browser is good if:

* You're uploading smaller datasets (less than tens of gigabytes)
* You don't want to install a special application to transfer data

In other cases it may be better to [upload data with the Globus Connect
Personal application](gcp.md).

When uploading data with your web browser the transfer is protected with HTTPS
encryption to keep your data safe in transit.

* If you'd like to test the platform we recommend using a [small synthetic dataset](../data.md) we provide
