# Upload genomes with your web browser

Uploading with your web browser is good if:

* You're uploading smaller datasets (less than tens of gigabytes)
* You don't want to install a special application to transfer data

In other cases it may be better to [upload data with Globus Connect
Personal](gcp.md).

When uploading data with your web browser the transfer is protected with HTTPS
encryption to keep your data safe in transit.

:::tip

* If you'd like to test the platform we recommend using this [small synthetic dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GsRZFB6V4ifi7PcVtdMX4ZphQgUrDI0n?usp=sharing) ([HAPNEST](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37647640/))
  
* The small HAPNEST synthetic data have been tested with the polygenic scores below:
  * [PGS000882](https://www.pgscatalog.org/score/PGS000882/) (vitamin D
  measurement)
  * [PGS001229](https://www.pgscatalog.org/score/PGS001229/)
