# Security overview

`GeneticScores.org` handles human data and as such security is a prime concern.

This document provides an overview of our practices in ensuring the security of the data handled by `GeneticScores.org`.

The key points of `GeneticScores.org` security strategy are:

## 1. Regular Risk Assessment

`GeneticScores.org` regularly identifies and assesses risk related to the following:

* Breach of confidentiality
* Breach of privacy or autonomy
* Malicious or accidental corruption or destruction of data
* Disruption of services provided by `GeneticScores.org`

## 2. Risk mitigation

* `GeneticScores.org` implements and maintains safeguards to minimise the risks identified above in accordance with the 6 control objectives listed in Appendix 1 and outlined in the GA4GH Security and Infrastructure document.
* If a breach is discovered, `GeneticScores.org` applies a defined protocol to minimise damage.
* We perform vulnerability scans and application penetration tests to monitor the state of our service

## 3. Identity and authorisation management

* `GeneticScores.org` authenticates the identity of individuals or software accessing our services for processing data
* `GeneticScores.org` authorises only the submitter of data to access that data

## 4. Audit Logs

* `GeneticScores.org` maintains a set of logs recording:
  * Resource usage
  * Access logs
  * Service logs

## 5. Cryptography, communication  security, and data integrity

* All data transmitted to or from the GeneticScores.org is end-to-end encrypted and stored using strong encryption.
* Genetic data must be encrypted by the user before upload.
  * We generate unique [crypt4gh](https://www.ga4gh.org/news_item/crypt4gh-a-secure-method-for-sharing-human-genetic-data/) key pairs for each dataset, and users must use the public key to encrypt their data before upload. We use the matching private key to decrypt the data for processing.
* Encryption keys are not stored in the same system as the encrypted data.
  * Encryption keys expire after two weeks after creation (they are deleted by automated processes), which renders your data unreadable. The encrypted data is also automatically deleted after two weeks.
* Users may choose to delete their data at any time.

`GeneticScores.org` has a defined protocol defining the response in the event of a security breach.

The security measures implemented by our data sub-processor, Google Cloud Platform are outlined in [Appendix 2 of the Cloud Data Processing Addendum.](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-addendum?hl=en)

## Appendix 1

### GA4GH Control Objectives

* Control Objective 1: Implement technology safeguards to minimise the risk of unauthorised access, use, or disclosure of confidential and private data.

* Control Objective 2: Implement technology safeguards to minimise the risk of discovery, access, and use of individualsâ€™ clinical and genomic data, and individual identities, other than as authorised by applicable jurisdictional law, institutional policy, and individual consents.

* Control Objective 3: Implement technology safeguards to minimise the risk of accidental or malicious corruption or destruction of data.

* Control Objective 4: Implement technology safeguards to minimise the risk of disruption, degradation, and interruption of services enabling access to data.

* Control Objective 5: Implement technology safeguards to minimise the risk of potential security attacks and misuse of authorised accesses and privileges.

* Control Objective 6: Implement technology safeguards to promptly detect the failure to attain the above control objectives and to respond with proper countermeasures.
